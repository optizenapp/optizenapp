Capsules are typically given with a treat or hidden in a soft treat pocket. Hemp oil treats are a tasty way to provide the benefits, and topical solutions can be applied directly to the skin as needed. It's essential to follow the recommended dosage instructions provided on the product label, which may differ based on your dog's size and specific needs."

Be patient and monitor your dog's response to the hemp oil. It's essential to follow the recommended dosage and consult with your veterinarian for guidance on the best approach for your pet's needs."
