When a video shows the tangible benefit of an upgrade, like a side-by-side comparison where one product clearly outperforms the other, it feels less like a pitch and more like a helpful demonstration. It's providing evidence, not just making claims. This visual proof reduces the perceived risk for the shopper, giving them the confidence to spend more."

Placing the video as an optional-to-watch thumbnail on a product page or as a subtle offer after an item is added to the cart is usually the best approach. Avoid auto-playing videos with sound or aggressive pop-ups that interrupt the shopping flow. The goal is to offer valuable information to those who are interested."
