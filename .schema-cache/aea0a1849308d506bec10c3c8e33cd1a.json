        "description": "<p>In April 2024, a research paper was published by Aounon Kumar,&nbsp;Himabindu Lakkaraju from Harvard University title: Manipulating Large Language Models to Increase Product Visibility. The paper investigates the possibility of manipulating large language models (LLMs) to enhance product visibility. The authors demonstrate that by adding a carefully crafted strategic text sequence (STS) to a product&#8217;s [&hellip;]</p>\n",
