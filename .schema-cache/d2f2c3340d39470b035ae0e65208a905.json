When an order containing that bundle comes through, the app's code intercepts the transaction (typically using Shopify's webhooks) and, instead of telling Shopify 'one bundle was sold,' it tells Shopify 'one of SKU A, one of SKU B, and one of SKU C were sold.' It breaks the bundle down into its constituent parts before it hits your inventory system, so your stock levels remain perfectly accurate."

You're looking for something that makes the customer feel like they're getting a genuinely good deal. A common starting point is 15-20% off the total price of the individual items. The key is to use the 'compare-at price' feature to visually show the original combined price crossed out next to the new bundle price. That visual cue is incredibly powerful."

Instead of having to research and decide on three or four complementary products, the customer is presented with a curated, expert-approved solution. It says, 'We've done the work for you; this is everything you need.' That's a huge value-add, especially for customers new to your product category. It builds trust and makes the shopping experience smoother and more satisfying."

              "@type": "Answer",
              "text": "Depends on your catalog, but offering tiers can be very smart. Think 'Basic Starter Kit' vs. 'Deluxe Pro Kit.' This caters to different customer needs and budgets. It's a classic 'Good, Better, Best' pricing strategy. It gives shoppers a sense of choice and control while still guiding them toward a curated solution, which often encourages them to upgrade to the higher-value option. It provides convenience at multiple price points."
