# Adding the OptizenAI Logo

## Steps to add your logo:

1. Save your logo image as `optizen-logo.png` 
2. Place it in the `/public` folder: `/Users/jonofarrington/Documents/Cursor Project/optizenapp2/public/optizen-logo.png`
3. The logo should be in PNG format with a transparent background
4. Recommended size: 600px wide x 170px tall (or similar aspect ratio)

The website is already configured to use this logo in:
- Header navigation
- Footer
- All responsive breakpoints

## Brand Colors Used:
- **Blue:** #0577E9 (Primary brand blue)
