## Page 1: What Is Optizen Video Upsell?
**WordPress Slug:** `what-is-optizen-video-upsell`
**Next.js URL:** `/support-docs/video-upsells/introduction`

### Content:

Optizen Video Upsell is a powerful Shopify app that leverages your own or AI-generated video content to showcase complementary products directly on your store's product pages. Instead of relying on static images or text, Optizen creates engaging video demonstrations that capture attention and drive additional purchases at the moment your customers are most ready to buy.

Here's how it works: When a customer views a product page, Optizen intelligently displays a targeted video upsell featuring a related item—complete with an exclusive discount. The video plays in a beautiful modal overlay, highlighting the benefits and features of the complementary product in a compelling 15-30 second presentation. With just one click, customers can add the upsell to their cart as an individual item or bundled together with the current product, while the discount is automatically applied at checkout.

### 💰 Why It Increases Revenue

Video content converts 80% better than static images because it creates an emotional connection and demonstrates value instantly. By presenting relevant upsells at the perfect moment—when customers are already in a buying mindset—you dramatically increase Average Order Value (AOV). The combination of AI-powered personalization, strategic timing, and exclusive discounts creates urgency that drives immediate action.

Most merchants see AOV increases of 20-35% within the first month, with some top performers achieving 50%+ gains. Because the upsells are contextual and the videos—whether your own or AI-generated—are professionally presented, customers perceive them as helpful recommendations rather than intrusive sales tactics, resulting in higher conversion rates and customer satisfaction.

### 📹 Using Your Own Videos

Optizen supports embedding your existing YouTube or Vimeo videos directly into your campaigns. This is perfect if you already have professional product content or want to use videos you've created for other marketing channels.

**Video Types That Work Best:**
- **Product Demos:** Show your product in action and highlight key features
- **Ad Reels:** Repurpose your existing social media or advertising video content
- **Product CTAs:** Direct call-to-action videos encouraging customers to add the upsell

**📋 Video Requirements:**
- **Platforms:** YouTube, Vimeo, TikTok, or Uploaded files
- **Privacy:** Videos must be set to Public (not unlisted or private) for hosted platforms
- **Dimensions:** Use YouTube Shorts for vertical/portrait videos (9:16) or standard dimensions for landscape (16:9)
- **Length:** Keep videos under 60 seconds for best engagement

### 🤖 AI Video Generation

Our state-of-the-art AI video generator creates professional product videos in minutes. Simply provide your product URL, and our system automatically extracts product information from the page to generate a compelling video presentation.

**How It Works:**
1. **Add Product URL:** Paste your Shopify product page URL
2. **Automatic Information Extraction:** Our system reads your product title, description, and images
3. **Custom Prompt (Optional):** Add specific talking points or benefits to emphasize
4. **Personalize:** Choose voice accent, gender, and avatar/persona
5. **Select Dimensions:** Pick from 3 aspect ratios - 16:9 (landscape), 9:16 (portrait), or 1:1 (square)

**✨ Customization Options:**
- **Voice Accent:** Choose from 240+ professional AI voices in multiple languages and accents
- **Gender:** Select male, female, or neutral voice options
- **Avatar/Persona:** Pick from diverse AI presenters to match your brand
- **Aspect Ratios:** 16:9 for desktop, 9:16 for mobile/shorts, 1:1 for universal use

**💾 Video Library:**
When you generate an AI video, you'll have the option to click "Save to Video Library" to add it to your library. Once saved, you can reuse videos across multiple campaigns without having to regenerate them, saving time and AI credits. Simply select a video from your library when creating a new campaign instead of generating a new one.
